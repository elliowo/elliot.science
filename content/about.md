## {{< small-icon user-tie-solid >}} Who am I?

My name is Elliot, a British web-developer with experience in system administration. I am 
hoping to transisition towards software engineering. Programming languages I use 
regularly are Rust, Python and C# but I also know some basics of C, C++ and more. With
my experience I am able to quickly adapt and work with new languages, when necessary.
