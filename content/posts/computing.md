# How I do my computing

## Preface

To start off with I will mention that every part of my setup is overkill for my use case, but 
was all obtained for resonable prices in comparison. My main use of a computer is general mostly 
browsing for information, programming/work/tinkering and the rare occasion of a game.

## Software

### Window Manager
I personally prefer a window manager to a desktop enviroment, since I don't use most
aspects. The window manager that I use a custom patched version of DWM. This is
managed by the package manager on gentoo, emerge.

### Web-browser
I use a hardened version of standard firefox with [arkenfox user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/) with RFP and libreJS 
when possible.

### Text/code editor
My choice in editor is emacs. I haven't really tried vim or other editors in comparison. I 
learnt emacs and was happy with it and was too lazy to learn vim properly. I use it for 
text editing on my server, since it was just easier to setup.
